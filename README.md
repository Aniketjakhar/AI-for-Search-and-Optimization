Assignment of AI for Search and Optimization 
1. Install the required libraries (numpy, matplotlib, tqdm).

2. Open the aisoproject.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the first cell to import all necessary libraries.

4. Run the Utility Functions section (these are used by all algorithms).

5. Execute each algorithm section in order, such as:

Standard Hill Climbing

Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing

Stochastic Hill Climbing

Simulated Annealing

Tabu Search

Genetic Algorithm

6. Run the visualisation cells to see performance graphs.

7. Check the comparison tables at the end of the notebook for final results.

8. Use Restart & Run All if you want to run the entire notebook automatically.
